# Onboarding Completion Feature - Backend Changes

This document describes the backend changes made to support the onboarding completion feature.

## Overview
The onboarding completion feature allows the system to track whether a user has completed the initial onboarding process. This prevents users from being redirected to onboarding on subsequent logins from different devices/browsers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### MainAdminUser Model (`Models/MainAdminUser.cs`)
- Added `OnboardingCompleted` boolean field with default value `false`

#### Database Migration (`Migrations/20250915120000_AddOnboardingCompleted.cs`)
- Created migration to add `OnboardingCompleted` column to `MainAdminUsers` table
- Set default value to `false` for existing users

#### Database Context (`Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`)
- Added default value configuration for `OnboardingCompleted` field

### 2. API Changes

#### DTOs (`DTOs/AuthDTOs.cs`)
- **UserDto**: Added `OnboardingCompleted` property
- **UpdateUserRequestDto**: Added nullable `OnboardingCompleted` property

#### AuthService (`Services/AuthService.cs`)
- **MapToUserDto**: Now includes `OnboardingCompleted` in user response
- **UpdateUserAsync**: Now handles updating `OnboardingCompleted` field

### 3. Behavior Changes

#### New User Registration
- New users automatically get `OnboardingCompleted = false`
- Frontend will redirect new users to onboarding flow

#### Existing User Login
- User's `OnboardingCompleted` status is returned in all auth responses
- Frontend checks this field to determine routing (dashboard vs onboarding)

#### Onboarding Completion
- When user completes onboarding, frontend calls update API with `OnboardingCompleted = true`
- This marks the user as having completed onboarding permanently

## API Endpoints Updated

All endpoints that return user data now include the `OnboardingCompleted` field:

- `POST /api/Auth/login` - Returns user with onboarding status
- `POST /api/Auth/signup` - Returns new user with `OnboardingCompleted = false`
- `GET /api/Auth/me` - Returns current user with onboarding status
- `GET /api/Auth/user/{id}` - Returns user with onboarding status
- `PUT /api/Auth/user/{id}` - Can update onboarding status and returns updated user
- `POST /api/Auth/refresh` - Returns user with onboarding status

## Usage Example

### Completing Onboarding (Frontend)
```typescript
// When user completes onboarding
await authService.updateUser({ onboardingCompleted: true });
```

### Checking Onboarding Status (Frontend)
```typescript
const user = authService.getCurrentUserFromStorage();
const needsOnboarding = !user?.onboardingCompleted;

if (needsOnboarding) {
  navigate('/onboarding');
} else {
  navigate('/dashboard');
}
```

## Database Migration

To apply the migration in production:

```bash
# Add migration (already created)
dotnet ef migrations add AddOnboardingCompleted

# Update database
dotnet ef database update
```

## Testing

1. **New Users**: Should have `OnboardingCompleted = false` and be redirected to onboarding
2. **Existing Users**: Should have `OnboardingCompleted = false` initially, but can be updated
3. **Completed Users**: Should have `OnboardingCompleted = true` and go directly to dashboard
4. **Cross-device**: Users who completed onboarding should go to dashboard on any device

## Notes

- All existing users will have `OnboardingCompleted = false` after migration
- The field is nullable in `UpdateUserRequestDto` to allow partial updates
- The field is non-nullable in `UserDto` and `MainAdminUser` with default `false`
- Frontend localStorage is used as backup, but server data is the source of truth
